Connect 4 was an interesting project to make. When we first starting prepping & planning for this project , we did'nt know how we wanted to approach the creations of the buttons, how we are going to move between page, and more. Once we established how to render our buttons for the grid it became pretty easy. The last thing that really gave us a tough time was the AI for the singleplayer. We where able to get it after a few times trying.

## How-To-Play
The game is very simple to play, all you have to do is first select the mode you want to play in. After that if you picked two-player it will prompt you for your name an d color you want to do for the token. Then it will take you to the game and allow you to player. Once a winner or draw is found it will take you to the win screen letting you know who one and show you some options. There is also a stats page where you can view your personalized stats.
