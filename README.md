Connect 4 was an interesting project to make. When we first starting prepping & planning for this project , we did'nt know how we wanted to approach the creations of the buttons, how we are going to move between page, and more. Once we established how to render our buttons for the grid it became pretty easy. The last thing that really gave us a tough time was the AI for the singleplayer. We where able to get it after a few times trying.

## How-To-Play
To begin playing the game, the user must first select their desired game mode. Upon selecting the two-player mode, the user will be prompted to enter their name and choose a color for their token. Once this information is entered, the game board will be displayed and the user can begin playing.

As the game progresses, the software will keep track of the game state and determine when a winner or draw has been reached. When the game concludes, the user will be directed to a win screen, which will display the winner's name and provide options for further action.

In addition to the gameplay features, the software also includes a statistics page that allows users to view their personal game statistics, providing an added layer of engagement for users who wish to track their progress over time.
